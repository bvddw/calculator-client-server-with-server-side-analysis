This is the calculator, created like a client-server app, using winsock2 library. 
The analysis of input data realized on server side, which is actually not very good,
because we can do it on client side, and make server less loaded. So it is better to realize 
validating and analysis of input data in client-part, like it done in this repo: https://github.com/bvddw/calculator-client-server-with-client-side-analysis.
